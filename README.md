# Machine-Learning-A-to-Z-Codes
Repository which consists different code snippets and projects for recorded every machine-learning algorithm i have learned by my self leaning python code for each algorithm.

Contains the code and implementation of the following topics and techniques:

1.Data Preprocessing
- Importing the dataset
- Dealing with missing data
- Splitting the data into test set and training set
- Feature Scalling

2.Regression
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Linear Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression

3.Classification
-Logistic Regression
-K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
-Support Vector Machine (SVM)
-Kernel SVM
-Naive Bayse
-Decision Tree Classifiers
-Random Forest Classifiers

4.Clustering
-K-Means Clustering
-Hierarchical Clustering

5.Association Rule Learning
-Apriori
