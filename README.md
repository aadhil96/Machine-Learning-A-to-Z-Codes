# Machine-Learning-A-to-Z-Codes
Repository which consists different code snippets and projects for recorded every machine-learning algorithm i have learned by my self leaning python code for each algorithm.

Contains the code and implementation of the following topics and techniques:
- Data Preprocessing
1. Importing the dataset
Dealing with missing data
Splitting the data into test set and training set
Feature Scalling
Regression
